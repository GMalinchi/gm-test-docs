HttpClient
==========

Angular comes with its own service for making HTTP requests. The HttpClient in **@angular/common/http** offers a simplified client HTTP API for Angular applications that rests on the XMLHttpRequest interface exposed by browsers.

Before you can use the HttpClient, you need to import the Angular HttpClientModule. Most apps do so in the root AppModule.

.. code-block:: typescript

    import { HttpClientModule } from '@angular/common/http';

    @NgModule({
      imports: [
        BrowserModule,
        // Import HttpClientModule after BrowserModule.
        HttpClientModule,
      ],
      declarations: [
        AppComponent,
      ],
      bootstrap: [ AppComponent ]
    })
    export class AppModule {}

Having imported HttpClientModule into the AppModule, you can inject the HttpClient into an application class, eg. a service.

HttpClient exposes methods for HTTP calls such as: *get*, *post*, *delete*, *put*. These methods return an Observable object which means that the caller must **subscribe** to the method's return value in order to have the HTTP request executed.

.. note::
    It is recommended to define specific service to hold the API interactions, instead of making the http calls directly in the component; this way, the components are easier to understand or test and the logic can be reused.
