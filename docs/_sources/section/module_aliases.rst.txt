Module aliases
==============

The project created with the Angular CLI already includes the ``tsconfig.json`` file which allows to define absolute
module paths instead of relative ones. Besides having the imports shorter and easier to read, the biggest advantage
of using absolute paths is that the application will not break as we refactor and move files around.

Example of tsconfig (excerpt):

.. code-block:: json

    {
        "compilerOptions": {
            "baseUrl": "./src",
            "paths": {
                "@app/utils/*": ["app/utils/*"],
                "@app/pipes/*": ["app/pipes/*"]
            }
        }
    }
